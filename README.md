# Crowdfunding Project

This project demonstrates a crowdfunding use case.

## What is crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising money from a large number of people,
in modern times typically via the Internet. Depending on the type of crowdfunding, investors either donate money altruistically or get rewards such as equity in the company that raised the money.Large groups of people pool together small individual investments to provide the capital needed to get a company or project off the ground. Individuals, charities, or companies can create a campaign for specific causes and anyone can contribute.

## SmartContrat + Crowdfunding

With use of smart contracts in crowdfunding, the risk is reduced to zero since smart contracts are immutable. In such cases, the fear of donation being missued or stolen is eliminated. Instead of donating via a company, contributors will donate to the smart contract which is specifically desinged to execute transaction from contributors directlty to the cause. The company will only be able to withdraw money(ethers) from smart contract only when more than 50% of contributors agree for the withdrawal.
